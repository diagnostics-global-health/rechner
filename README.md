A simple calculator to convert the sensitivity and specificity of a SARS-CoV-2
rapid antigen test, as listed at https://diagnosticsglobalhealth.org/,
into concrete numbers of true and false test results,
given the current incidence rate in the population.

The user provides

- Incidence
- Sensitivity
- Specificity

The calculator then displays the expected number of

- True Positive
- True Negative
- False Positive
- False Negative

results if 1000 people are tested, along with the corresponding

- Positive Predictive Value
- Negative Predictive Value
